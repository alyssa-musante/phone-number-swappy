Type in up to three phone number combinations. Use main phone number and alternate phone number pairs. The "Alt" phone number will be swapped out via jQuery when a user has been referred to by yahoo, bing or google.

Three options for jQuery target can be set. These are meant to be a span id to swap with jQuery.

A cookie is saved tracking referral, the cookie's expiration can also be set (default 7 days).
